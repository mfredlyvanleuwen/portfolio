Messi began his career with FC Barcelona and stayed at the Spanish club until joining Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2021.

Over the course of 778 games with the club, Messi scored 672 goals, ahead of Brazil great Pele, who scored 643 goals while playing for Santos. At Barcelona, Messi leads Cesar Rodriguez, who scored 446 goals for the Spanish giants.
